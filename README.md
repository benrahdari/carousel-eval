## An Infrastructure for Evaluation of Carousel-Based Recommender Interfaces

Carousel-based interfaces are integral to enhancing user experience in online recommender systems such as streaming services or e-commerce platforms, yet their usability evaluation often lacks a standardized approach. 
While there is existing work on supporting the process of evaluation of recommender systems - from toolkits to infrastructure - they predominantly concentrate on assessing the recommendation algorithms rather than the user experience. This focus results in a limited understanding of the overall effectiveness of modern recommender systems, as it overlooks the role of user interface design, particularly carousel-based interfaces, in overall user experience. 
In response to this gap, we introduce a web-based infrastructure specifically designed for the usability assessment of carousel-based interfaces. Our infrastructure is versatile, suitable for various domains and experimental setups, and holds the potential for expansion due to its modular design.
